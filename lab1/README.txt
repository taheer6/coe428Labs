For the first part of the lab (Tutorial 1), I copied the code onto my file, ran and compiled just fine. 
For implementing mySort, I used an insertion sort algorithm with O(n^2) time complexity to sort the array. 
I then ran the command line arguement for the demo successfully.
Finally, the main function was coded using an if/else statement including the argc function to identify the amount of arguments being passed and argv to convert the given arguments to integers.

The only problem I had was that I ran the code on my local machine as the Bitvide terminal was giving me a permission error when running/executing.
I made the effort to come on Saturday and try to resolve the issue on a school computer but the labs were closed.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find the issue to the terminal error, but the process was smooth on my local terminal.

Question:

The better sort function would be implemented by starting from index zero until (data[] - 1).
Then use the insertion sort to compare each element in the array with temporary variables. 
Then do as the insertion sort will do to arrange all the elements in ascending order.
